c\_snippets
===========

A collection of reusable C code snippets meant for easy copying into projects.

Or, things I've had to type several times before and decided to leave them
somewhere handy for when I have to do so again in the future.

These tend to be things I would normally grab from a library, but cannot use it
in a particular environment I'm working in (usually Borland Turbo C for DOS).
So you'll see things like strict C90 conformance and workarounds for that kind
of world.
